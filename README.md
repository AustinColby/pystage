# PyStage

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pystage/badge/?version=latest)](https://pystage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Scratch-like Python programming.

PyStage bridges the gap between [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and Python. This module implements all code blocks
as available in scratch. With the PyStage command line converter Scratch projects can be easily
transferred to Python executable Code.
